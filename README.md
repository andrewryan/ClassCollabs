# ClassCollabs
This project uses Django channels and Websockets to implement a user chat system and uses Redis for database storage. A user must register, and from there they will be logged in, and can then enroll in a class to become a member of. Once enrolled in a class the user will be able to send other users in their group a private message. Or, they can utilize a live chat system to ask questions or get help with their work from other classmates. This project was developed using tutorials from RealPython-Django-Channels and uses a folder called ws4redis from Django-readthedocs tutorial for the chat channel.
